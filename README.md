# Supply Chain Optimization: Data Analysis Project

This project involves analyzing supply chain data to optimize operations and make data-driven decisions. The primary goal is to leverage a dataset from Kaggle and apply data analysis techniques to extract insights that can help improve supply chain efficiency.

## Project Overview

This repository contains Python code that was originally developed in a Jupyter Notebook, with the goal of optimizing supply chain management through data analysis. It involves data processing, exploratory data analysis, and potentially building machine learning models to improve key performance indicators related to the supply chain.

### Key Features:

- **Data Loading & Preprocessing:** Automates the process of loading the Kaggle dataset and performing necessary preprocessing steps such as cleaning and formatting data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes and explores key features of the dataset to uncover patterns and trends.
- **Supply Chain Optimization:** Applies optimization algorithms and data-driven techniques to suggest improvements in supply chain processes.

## Requirements

Before running the project, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn (if applicable)

##Dataset
The dataset used in this project comes from Kaggle and can be found here<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshsingh2209/supply-chain-analysis>. It contains real-world data related to supply chain operations, including metrics such as:

*Inventory levels
*Order processing times
*Supplier information
*Shipment and delivery time

##Future Enhancements

*Machine Learning Integration: Adding predictive models to forecast demand and optimize stock levels.
*Advanced Visualization: Incorporating interactive plots to explore data more effectively.
*Dashboard Integration: Build a web-based dashboard to display key supply chain metrics in real-time.
